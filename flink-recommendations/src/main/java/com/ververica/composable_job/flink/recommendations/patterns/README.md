## 🗂️ Pattern Catalog

### Pattern 01: Session Windows 🪟

**File:** [`01_session_windows/SessionWindowExample.java`](01_session_windows/SessionWindowExample.java)
**README:** [`01_session_windows/README.md`](01_session_windows/README.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Group events by natural user sessions based on inactivity gaps
- Configure session gaps (e.g., 30-minute timeout)
- Aggregate all events within a session
- Classify sessions (PURCHASE, ABANDONED_CART, BROWSER, QUICK_VISIT)

**Use cases:**
- Shopping session analysis
- Device activity bursts (IoT)
- User engagement tracking
- Log file analysis

**Key concepts:**
```java
DataStream<ShoppingSession> sessions = events
    .assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(watermarkStrategy)
    .keyBy(event -> event.sessionId)
    .window(EventTimeSessionWindows.withGap(Time.minutes(30)))
    .process(new SessionAggregator());
```

**Estimated time:** 60-90 minutes

---

### Pattern 02: Broadcast State 📡

**File:** [`02_broadcast_state/BroadcastStateExample.java`](02_broadcast_state/BroadcastStateExample.java)
**README:** [`02_broadcast_state/README.md`](02_broadcast_state/README.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Distribute low-throughput data (ML models, configs) to ALL parallel tasks
- Connect high-throughput and low-throughput streams
- Update broadcast state dynamically during job execution
- Apply ML models for real-time inference

**Use cases:**
- ML model distribution (this example!)
- Configuration/feature flag updates
- Dimension table enrichment
- Dynamic fraud rule distribution

**Key concepts:**
```java
// Broadcast ML model to all tasks
BroadcastStream<MLModel> modelBroadcast = modelUpdates
    .broadcast(modelStateDescriptor);

// Connect user events with broadcasted model
DataStream<Recommendation> recommendations = userEvents
    .connect(modelBroadcast)
    .process(new RecommendationEnricher(modelStateDescriptor));
```

**Estimated time:** 60-90 minutes

---

### Pattern 03: Complex Event Processing (CEP) 🔍

**File:** [`03_cep/CEPCartAbandonmentExample.java`](03_cep/CEPCartAbandonmentExample.java)
**README:** [`03_cep/README.md`](03_cep/README.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Detect sequential event patterns declaratively
- Use pattern API (begin, next, followedBy, where, within)
- Apply quantifiers (oneOrMore, times(n), optional)
- Handle time constraints for pattern matching

**Use cases:**
- Cart abandonment detection (this example!)
- Fraud detection (unusual transaction sequences)
- User journey tracking (signup → activation → purchase)
- System monitoring (error → warning → critical)

**Key concepts:**
```java
// Pattern: Add to cart but no purchase within 30 min
Pattern<Event, ?> cartAbandonmentPattern = Pattern
    .<Event>begin("add-to-cart")
    .where(e -> e.type.equals("ADD_TO_CART"))
    .oneOrMore()
    .followedBy("no-purchase")
    .where(e -> !e.type.equals("PURCHASE"))
    .oneOrMore().optional()
    .within(Time.minutes(30));

PatternStream<Event> matches = CEP.pattern(events, cartAbandonmentPattern);
DataStream<Alert> alerts = matches.select(new AbandonmentSelectFunction());
```

**Estimated time:** 90-120 minutes

---

### Pattern 04: ML Classification with Hybrid Sources & Side Outputs 🤖

**File:** [`04_ml_classification/MLClassificationExample.java`](04_ml_classification/MLClassificationExample.java)
**README:** [`04_ml_classification/README.md`](04_ml_classification/README.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Combine hybrid sources (bounded → unbounded) with ML inference
- Implement logistic regression for binary classification in Flink
- Use side outputs to route classified results to different pipelines
- Bootstrap ML models with historical data before processing live streams
- Performance considerations for real-time ML inference

**Use cases:**
- Fraud detection (classify transactions as fraud/legitimate)
- Customer segmentation (high-value vs standard customers)
- Quality control (defective vs good products)
- Churn prediction (likely-to-churn vs stable customers)
- Lead scoring (hot vs cold leads)

**Key concepts:**
```java
// STEP 1: Create hybrid source (historical → live)
HybridSource<String> source = HybridSource.builder(fileSource)
    .addSource(kafkaSource)
    .build();

// STEP 2: Apply ML classification with side outputs
SingleOutputStreamOperator<ClassifiedPurchase> standardStream = purchaseStream
    .process(new MLClassificationProcessor());

// STEP 3: Extract side outputs based on classification
DataStream<ClassifiedPurchase> highValueStream =
    standardStream.getSideOutput(HIGH_VALUE_TAG);

// Mathematical model:
// P(high_value) = σ(w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + w₃x₃)
// where σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))  [sigmoid function]
```

**Estimated time:** 90-120 minutes

## 🧩 Pattern Comparison

### When to Use Each Pattern

| Requirement | Pattern | Why |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Group events by user activity periods | 01: Session Windows | Natural session boundaries |
| Distribute ML model to all tasks | 02: Broadcast State | Low-throughput updates |
| Detect cart abandonment sequence | 03: CEP | Sequential pattern matching |
| Track shopping session metrics | 01: Session Windows | Aggregate events in session |
| Apply same config to all tasks | 02: Broadcast State | Replicate to all parallel tasks |
| Detect fraud sequences | 03: CEP | Complex event sequences |

### Pattern Combinations

**Example: Full Recommendation Pipeline**

```
Session Windows (Pattern 01)
  ↓ Aggregate user behavior in sessions
  ↓
Broadcast State (Pattern 02)
  ↓ Apply ML model for recommendations
  ↓
CEP (Pattern 03)
  ↓ Detect cart abandonment → Trigger alert
  ↓
Final Output: Personalized recommendations + abandonment recovery
```

See [`BasketAnalysisJob.java`](../BasketAnalysisJob.java) for complete integration example.

## 📊 Pattern Characteristics

### Performance Comparison

| Pattern | State Size | CPU Usage | Complexity | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Session Windows** | Medium (buffer events until window closes) | Medium | Low | User sessions, activity bursts |
| **Broadcast State** | Small (replicated to all tasks) | Low | Low | ML models, configs, rules |
| **CEP** | Medium-High (pattern state per key) | Medium-High | Medium | Fraud detection, workflows |

### Memory Footprint

```
Session Windows:
  Memory = (avg events per session) × (key cardinality) × (event size)
  Example: 10 events × 1000 sessions × 100 bytes = 1 MB

Broadcast State:
  Memory = (broadcast data size) × (parallelism)
  Example: 10 MB model × 10 tasks = 100 MB

CEP:
  Memory = (pattern complexity) × (key cardinality) × (avg events buffered)
  Example: Complex pattern × 1000 users × 20 events = variable
```

## 💡 Teaching Tips

### For Instructors

**Workshop Facilitation:**
1. Start with live demo of each pattern
2. Students read relevant README section (15-20 min)
3. Guided exercise completion (30-45 min)
4. Group discussion of solutions
5. Quiz to reinforce learning

**Common Student Questions:**

Q: "When do I use session windows vs CEP?"
A: Session windows = unordered event aggregation; CEP = ordered event sequences

Q: "Why does broadcast state replicate to all tasks?"
A: So each task has local copy for fast access (no network calls during processing)

Q: "What's the difference between `.next()` and `.followedBy()` in CEP?"
A: `.next()` = strict (immediate next event); `.followedBy()` = relaxed (can have events between)

### For Self-Study

**Effective Learning Strategy:**
1. Read pattern README in full (don't skip sections!)
2. Run example and observe output
3. Modify example (change parameters, add logging)
4. Complete exercises without looking at solutions first
5. Compare your solution to provided solution
6. Take quiz to test understanding
7. Move to next pattern

**Debugging Tips:**
- Enable debug logging: `log4j.logger.org.apache.flink=DEBUG`
- Use `.print()` operators to inspect stream contents
- Check Flink Web UI for backpressure and metrics
- Review checkpoint sizes for state growth
